                    <p class="text-muted">My philosophy in teaching music is to tailor each lesson to my student's wants and needs. We all learn our best when we are intrinsically motivated. When we are allowed to chase our unique interests, we progress much faster and have more fun doing it! Some students have a need to understand the theory behind every chord, while others want to just dive right in and play. Whatever your learning style, I will make sure that we are reinforcing good playing. My secret sauce is giving you what you want and supplementing it with what you need.</p>

"Our elementary school-aged sons Eli and Rowan were fortunate enough to have Tovi as their music instructor for three years.  In that time both of them progressed from beginners to competent and dynamic musicians.  We were amazed at the transformation and frequently impressed at a new song they learned and brought home to share.We are thrilled at the self-esteem they've gained in developing such a wonderful skill.  But above all, we are so grateful for the mentorship presence Tovi has had on our boys.  He is skilled musician and gifted teacher, but he is also a kind, thoughtful, creative person that the boys couldn't wait to spend time with each week.  They miss him but will benefit for the rest of their lives  from those three years!"

                                    <p class="text-muted">"Tovi Newman has been my son Sam's electric guitar instructor for the past several years. It has been amazing to watch Sam progress from a complete novice to a motivated and passionate musician. It is not only Sam's guitar skills that have multiplied under Tovi's instruction, but his love of playing and of music itself. Tovi has a way of figuring out what students are interested in learning, and using that to expand their technical knowledge and broaden their horizons. While working with Tovi, I never had to urge Sam to practice guitar. He is always eager to play. That is a strong indicator of a great teacher; when a teacher's obvious enthusiasm for their subject is transferred to their students." - Jenna E.</p>

My son is very shy and anxious and Tovi had him feeling comfortable and confident instantly.  Tovi makes his students feel excited about music by helping them learn songs they know and love first.  Any time my son felt like he wanted to quit or he didn't want to practice at home anymore, all it took was a lesson with Tovi to get him excited again.  We saw amazing progress in my son's guitar playing abilities during his time with Tovi."<br>-Jessica D.</p>

I have a ten year old that Tovi taught piano and a twelve and fifteen year old that he worked with on guitar.  He was great with all three of them.  He did a nice job of keeping the kids constantly engaged by keeping the lessons interesting by utilizing contemporary music that they loved playing.  The fact that he was in a band (Swing 49) that was often playing in and around Anchorage gave him a lot of credibility with the kids.  This past summer, my son worked very closely with Tovi with the goal of making his middle school's Jazz Band.  In September, he made it!  With regard to the business end of the lessons, Tovi did everything right. He came early and often times stayed beyond scheduled lesson times to get a concept right.  The cost of his lessons were very reasonable, especially when you consider he came to our house for the lessons.  This alone was incredibly helpful for our family's schedule. I would highly recommend him to anyone.  We miss him." -Sean J.</p>
